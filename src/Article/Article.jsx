      <p>The Statue of Liberty&rsquo;s original torch is getting a new home.</p>

      <p>
        Made of copper and gold so that it would shine bright, the first torch
        took a beating from the weather and was replaced by a replica in 1984.
        It&rsquo;s been stored in the statue&rsquo;s pedestal ever since.
      </p>

      <p>
        But visitors will be able to see the original 3,600-pound torch in all
        its glory at a new Statue of Liberty Museum, which will open on Liberty
        Island in May 2019. The torch was transported there by truck last week,
        along with a replica model of Lady Liberty&rsquo;s face.

          Although it is not one of the most difficult things we have ever
          moved,
        </q>
        says Douglas Phelps, who oversaw the relocation of the torch,
        <q>it is certainly the most important.</q>
      </p>

      <h2>The history of the Statue of Liberty</h2>

      <p>
        Not only is the Statue of Liberty the symbol of New York City, she is
        also a UNESCO World Heritage site under the designation of
        <i>Outstanding Universal Value</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her full name is <b>Liberty Enlightening the World</b>, and she was designed by
        Frederic Auguste Bartholdi and built by Gustave Eiffel -- yes, the same
        guy who built Paris&rsquo;s Eiffel Tower.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lady Liberty was a gift from France to the United States to celebrate
        the centennial of their nation&rsquo;s independence -- although, somewhat
        awkwardly, she arrived a decade too late. Nevertheless, President Grover
        Cleveland formally unveiled her in 1886.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since then, the statue has served as a symbol of hope and possibility
        for many people who entered the United States as immigrants via
        neighboring Ellis Island.
      </p>

      <p>
        <q>
          The original torch is a beautiful object of art and exemplifies the
          American ideals of freedom and democracy,
        </q>
        says John Piltzecker, superintendent of the Statue of Liberty National
        Monument. That symbolic spirit inspired the decision to inscribe these
        famous lines on the statue&rsquo;s pedestal:
        <q>
          Give me your tired, your poor / Your huddled masses yearning to
          breathe free.
        </q>
      </p>

      <p>In 2017, nearly 4.5 million people visited Liberty Island.</p>

      <p>
        When completed, the Statue of Liberty Museum will be 26,000 square feet
        of history, inspiration and deeper analysis of the statue&rsquo;s symbolism
        both in the US and around the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        The inspiration gallery, which is where the torch will live, will have
        floor-to-ceiling glass windows looking out at Lower Manhattan, including
        the World Trade Center.
